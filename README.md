making a calculator in JAVAFX
  
  
  Last monthï¼Œour teacher asked us to do a curriculum design to test the ability we controled while I learned the JAVA two years ago,so I
refered someone's code that make a calculator too.But i had to add more fuctions to it. This version is that I just added 
trigonometric functions and a textarea showing the processing of calculating.
